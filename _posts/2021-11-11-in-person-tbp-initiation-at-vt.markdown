The Tau Beta Pi Virginia Beta chapter at Virginia Tech held its first in-person initiation ceremony in several years on November 11, 2021. Due to health concerns and capacity limitations arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, initiation ceremonies were previously held in a virtual environment on Zoom. Fortunately, improvements in conditions have enabled the opportunity for in-person events. At the initiation ceremony, the chapter initiated 20 engineering students in addition to eminent engineer Homer Hickam Jr. These former candidates earned their spots not only by being in the top of their class, but also by fulfilling academic, service, social, and general initiation requirements amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Offering a combination of virtual and in-person events promoted engagement and retention amongst candidates. Adaptability was critical for both candidates and the officer team to ensure a safe and successful initiation process for all. As a result, a new class of candidates were able to make a covenant with Tau Beta Pi.

A proud Virginia Tech alumnus who graduated in 1964 with a bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering, Homer Hickam Jr. led an impactful career as a NASA engineer, Army Vietnam veteran, and best-selling author. After the initiation ceremony, Hickam held a private book signing where TBP members could purchase some of his most notable memoirs, Rocket Boys and Don’t Blow Yourself Up. Successful orchestration of the ceremony was largely due to collaboration between TBP VA B chapter officers and District 4 Director, Russell Werneth. The officer team is looking forward to their second initiation ceremony of the fall semester on December 4, 2021. Moreover, they hope to continue in-person initiation ceremonies in the future.
